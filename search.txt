Search Algorithm

Big O Notation “O(n)”:
the worst runtime for a given algorithm. Measured by no. of operations running

Algorithm:
is the step-by-step procedures for solving a problem or the plan to start coding.
A way of thinking and organizing steps before coding.
Must be clear and care for time complexity.
Examples:
step1: start
step2: define inputs and make variables for them
step3: problem
step4: output
step5:end

also can use flow charts

const students = ["Adam", "Reham", "Mohamed", "Mona", "Ahmed"];


Linear Search:
best case when data is not sorted
search index-by-index

Binary Search:
for sorted data
it sets right point, left point, and mid point in the array and search where will be the value and update them (elimination to shorten the array)
